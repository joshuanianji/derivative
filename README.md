# Symbolic Derivatives

This project, inspired by [this Haskell blog post](http://5outh.blogspot.com/2013/05/symbolic-calculus-in-haskell.html) aims to provide symbolic differentiation along with user friendly input and output, via [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/). 

## Demo

## Run

Make sure you have `Elm` and `Node` installed (at least v14). 

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```

Special thanks to:

- Benjamin Kovach's [Symbolic Calculus in Haskell](http://5outh.blogspot.com/2013/05/symbolic-calculus-in-haskell.html), the blog post which inspired this project.

- [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/), for making it so easy manage LaTeX input and output.

- [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app), with which this project is bootstrapped.

- The [Elm Pratt Parser](https://github.com/dmy/elm-pratt-parser) library - this project wouldn't be possible without this package.

- [The Elm Language](https://elm-lang.org/), for being so easy to work with.
